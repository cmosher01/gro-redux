There's a new genealogy program available now. 
Genealogy Research Organizer (GRO). Finally! A 
program that shows individuals on a drop-line 
chart in a window. You can move the individuals 
wherever you want! And the lines connecting them 
re-draw automatically.

Now you can visualize your family tree and lay it 
out the way you want to.

Double-click on a person, and a window opens up 
where you edit all their information.

Of course, we all know how important it is to cite 
our sources. And so many genealogy programs today 
still do not let you store your source 
information. GRO lets you store a citation for 
each piece of information you gather!

All the data is stored in GEDCOM 5.5 standard 
format, so there's no worry about dealing with 
proprietary binary files that you can't edit.

A FREE demo version of GRO is available for 
download at the official GRO web site:

Remember, just Go To GRO!

If you like the program, you can order the full 
version on-line (through V-Share's Secure Server) 
and download it within minutes!
