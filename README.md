Genealogy Research Organizer (GRO) is a program for Windows that lets you manage your genealogy data.
Even complex family relationships become instantly clear, with GRO's intuitive drop-line chart. You
can arrange your ancestors as you desire, and GRO automatically draws the lines between individuals
representing their relationship.

Double-click individuals to see their events, attributes, partners, and children.

You may need to run in Windows XP compatibility mode.

Although previously available for purchase, GRO is now libre/open-source.

This is GRO (Redux!), the import of the original GRO program, V1.4, from revision 9656
of the old Assembla subversion repository.
